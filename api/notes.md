##### what does it called when values are extracted from request body in the constant in javascript.

  ` const { title, description, private: isPrivate, creator, image } = req.body; `

##### The process you're referring to is called destructuring assignment in JavaScript. Destructuring assignment allows you to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables. In the example you've provided:

` const { title, description, private: isPrivate, creator, image } = req.body; `

##### Here's what's happening:

- req.body is assumed to be an object containing several properties.
- The curly braces {} are used to destructure these properties directly from req.body.
- Each variable (title, description, creator, image) is being assigned the corresponding value from req.body.
- The syntax private: isPrivate renames the private property to isPrivate when assigning its value.

This is a concise and readable way to extract multiple properties from an object in one line.
